  <p>FAQ</p>
<p><strong>What is the Church Creatives Club?</strong></p>
<p>A place for church creatives to hang out.</p>
<p><strong>With so many other church creative related podcast/blog/discord/youtube/communities in existence, why create another one?</strong></p>
<p>The question should really be why not? I am already a part of many of these groups and what is neat is that they are all structured different and serve a different purpose. The goal of the Church Creatives Club is to be more of a social club for church designers to hang out and just be friends. Think of it like youth group but way cooler and you are not limited to two slices of pizza at the party.</p>
<p><strong>What is the e-magazine?</strong></p>
<p>The Church Creatives Club e-magazine is a electronic magazine in PDF format full of content from other church creatives. The goal is to release new issues as new content is submitted. This could be once a month, once a quarter or every six months. The community dictates the release date by the amount of content that is submitted.</p>
<p><strong>Why an e-magazine instead of the normal podcast/blog/discord/youtube?</strong></p>
<p>Being a 90&rsquo;s kid there is something nostalgic about a magazine. Growing up I had subscriptions to skateboarding, guitar, tech, automotive magazines and more. There was certain feeling of anticipation that came from knowing these magazines were coming out. In a world of instant information at your fingertips this is a welcome change and a little bit of nostalgia for those of us who remember the feeling of a new magazine in the mail.</p>
<p><strong>What are the future plans for CCC?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, the sky is the limit. I have had this crazy idea for a while and we will see where it goes. The first and foremost goal is to get the e-magazine up and going consistently. I am always open to ideas and suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Are you making money on this?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. So far it has not cost much out of pocket other than personal time to get this up and running. I have gotten pretty good and learning new skills and watching YouTube videos to DIY projects when money needs to be saved. Will I make money on this in the future? Who knows, but that is not the goal. Breaking even or coming out of pocket just a little bit is the goal.</p>
<p><strong>How can I join the club?</strong></p>
<p>The e-magazine is the easiest way to get involved. Check the magazine page out on this site to see all the different ways you can contribute. Another way is to just be a part of the community. Interacting with other church creatives is huge. Make new friends, ask questions, give advice. Just know this, whatever level of interaction you choose is OK and you are now a part of the club.</p>
<p><strong>If this is a “club”, does it cost anything to join?</strong></p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p><strong>If this is a “club”, do I get a membership card?</strong></p>
<p>That is actually a cool idea……stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>I have a question that hasn’t been answered.</strong></p>
<p>Shoot me an email or DM and I will try my best to answer it.</p>
